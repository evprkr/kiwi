# Kiwi
Kiwi is just a pet project of mine that I'm working on while I learn about programming language design. You can clone the repo to your computer, then run ``shell.py`` to play with Kiwi!

### Features
Kiwi is currently extremely barebones, so below is a list of features that have been implemented:
* Basic lexing for numbers and mathematical operators. Not actual math, just lexing of math!

### Code Examples
This is an example of the (future) syntax of Kiwi, which is still subject to change. The goal is to make it extremely easy to read, write, and understand.

	// Print FizzBuzz sequence
	for i to 100 >>
		if i % 15 is 0 >> say "FizzBuzz"
		elif i % 3 is 0 >> say "Fizz"
		elif i % 5 is 0 >> say "Buzz"
		else >> say i
		
<br>

	// Convert fahrenheit to celsius
		x = ask "What is the temperature today in F?"
		y = (x - 32) * 5/9
		say "That's {y} degrees celsius!"
