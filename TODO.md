This is a rough list of things I am planning to add to Kiwi, in no particular order.

* User function definitions and calls
* Data structures
	- lists (list = []) store any data type in a specific order
	- sets (set = ()) store one data type in a specific order
	- records (record = {}) store any data type with indices and keys, can be modified
* List functions
	- list.add(x) - appends x to the end of a list
	- list.rem(n) - removes n items from the end of a list
	- list.rem_all(x) - removes all instances of x from a list
	- list.empty() - removes all items from a list
 	- list.shuffle(seed) - returns the list/set in a random order
	- list.index(x) - returns the index (int) of item x in a list
* Built-in functions
	- 'ask' and 'say' for input and output
	- len(x) - returns the length (int) of items in an object
* Modules
	- Random - returning random numbers and other related functions
	- Math - more complex math functions (mod, sqrt, exp, etc.)
